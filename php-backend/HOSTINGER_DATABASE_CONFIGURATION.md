# Hostinger Database Configuration Guide

This guide explains how to properly configure your database credentials for the PHP backend on Hostinger.

## Finding Your Hostinger Database Credentials

1. **Log in to Hostinger hPanel**

   - Go to https://hpanel.hostinger.com/
   - Log in with your Hostinger account credentials

2. **Navigate to Database Section**

   - In the hPanel, find and click on "Databases"
   - Then click on "MySQL Databases"

3. **Create a Database (if not already created)**

   - Click "Create Database"
   - Choose a database name (e.g., "smartbets")
   - The system will automatically generate a username
   - Create a strong password and save it securely

4. **View Database Details**
   - After creation, you'll see your database details:
     - **Database Name**: The name you chose or was assigned
     - **Username**: Automatically generated by Hostinger
     - **Password**: The password you created
     - **Host**: Usually "localhost" (this is already set in the config file)

## Updating Database Configuration

1. **Open the Configuration File**

   - Locate `php-backend/config/database.php` in your project files
   - Open it with a text editor

2. **Update the Credentials**

   - Find the Hostinger configuration section (lines 5-9):
     ```php
     // Hostinger configuration - UPDATE THESE VALUES WITH YOUR HOSTINGER DATABASE CREDENTIALS
     $host = 'localhost';
     $db_name = 'your_hostinger_db_name';
     $username = 'your_hostinger_db_user';
     $password = 'your_hostinger_db_password';
     ```
   - Replace the placeholder values with your actual Hostinger database credentials:
     ```php
     // Hostinger configuration - UPDATE THESE VALUES WITH YOUR HOSTINGER DATABASE CREDENTIALS
     $host = 'localhost';
     $db_name = 'your_actual_database_name';
     $username = 'your_actual_database_username';
     $password = 'your_actual_database_password';
     ```

3. **Example Configuration**
   If your Hostinger database details are:

   - Database Name: `u123456789_smartbets`
   - Username: `u123456789_smartbets`
   - Password: `MySecurePassword123`

   Then your configuration should look like:

   ```php
   // Hostinger configuration - UPDATE THESE VALUES WITH YOUR HOSTINGER DATABASE CREDENTIALS
   $host = 'localhost';
   $db_name = 'u123456789_smartbets';
   $username = 'u123456789_smartbets';
   $password = 'MySecurePassword123';
   ```

## Testing the Connection

1. **Upload Files**

   - Upload all PHP backend files to your Hostinger account
   - Make sure `config/database.php` is uploaded with your updated credentials

2. **Run the Test Script**

   - Upload `php-backend/test.php` to your Hostinger account
   - Visit the file in your browser (e.g., `http://yourdomain.com/test.php`)
   - You should see database connection success messages

3. **Check for Errors**
   - If you see "Connection failed: Please update the database credentials...", you haven't updated the config file
   - If you see "Access denied for user...", double-check your credentials
   - If you see "Unknown database...", verify the database name is correct

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. "Please update the database credentials" Error

**Cause**: You haven't updated the placeholder values in `config/database.php`
**Solution**:

- Open `config/database.php`
- Replace `your_hostinger_db_name`, `your_hostinger_db_user`, and `your_hostinger_db_password` with your actual credentials
- Save and re-upload the file

### 2. "Access denied for user" Error

**Cause**: Incorrect username or password
**Solution**:

- Double-check your Hostinger database credentials in hPanel
- Ensure there are no extra spaces in the values
- Verify the password is correct (copy-paste to avoid typos)

### 3. "Unknown database" Error

**Cause**: Incorrect database name
**Solution**:

- Verify the database name in Hostinger hPanel
- Ensure the database has been created
- Check for typos in the database name

### 4. Connection Timeout Errors

**Cause**: Host or port issues
**Solution**:

- Ensure `$host = 'localhost';` (this is correct for most Hostinger accounts)
- The port is already set to 3306, which is standard for MySQL

## Security Best Practices

1. **Use Strong Passwords**

   - Create complex passwords for your database
   - Don't use the same password for multiple services

2. **Protect Configuration Files**

   - Ensure `config/database.php` is not accessible directly via web browser
   - The file should be outside the web root if possible

3. **Regular Updates**
   - Change database passwords periodically
   - Keep your PHP files updated with the latest security patches

## Need Help?

If you continue to experience issues:

1. Double-check all credentials in Hostinger hPanel
2. Verify the database exists and is active
3. Contact Hostinger support for database-specific issues
4. Ensure your Hostinger plan supports MySQL databases
